## Java Cats üêà

Repo: `hoxton-java-cats`

Description:

Today we will practice the fundamentals of java and Object oriented programming by creating a Cat class and playing around with class methods and overrides

Instructions
- Initialise a new Java project
- Create a Cat class. The cat should have these variables:
  - name (string)
  - age (integer)
  - likesCuddles (boolean)
  - favouriteToy(string)
- Create a cats ArrayList of Cat intances
- Create class methods:
  - to create a cat providing all the data
  - an override `toString` to be able to see the data we need.
  - a `printData` method, once run, the user should see something like:
"This is Oliver, who is 4 year(s) old. Oliver doesn't like cuddles. This cat's favourite toy is an empty can of coke"
- Create a block of code that executes when the app starts. The block should:
  - Populate the Cat class with 3 instances
  - Once created, print every cat's data to the console using the method you've created

Challenge
Ask the user to input some cat data. After they have provided a cat, add the cat to the list of cats and print its data with the other 3.
